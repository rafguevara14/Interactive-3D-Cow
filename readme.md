A 3D interactive cow rendered in WebGL to explore the Phong Reflection Model. Two light sources are present in the scene. A point light rotates above the cow and a spotlight pans left and right up and behind the cow.

I used the following resources to help with the assignment

### Controls: 
left click - translation 

right click - rotation

p - start/stop rotating light

s - start/stop panning light

r - reset position

### Additional features:

I don't believe attenuation based on distance was a requirement, but I added it 
to show more variation as the light sources move through the scene
